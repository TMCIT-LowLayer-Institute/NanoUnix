**xv6 Operating System**
========================

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix Version 6 (v6). xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6 but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

**Build and Run xv6**
---------------------

To build and run xv6, you will need a RISC-V "newlib" toolchain, available from riscv-gnu-toolchain. Additionally, qemu compiled for riscv64-softmmu is required. Once installed and in your shell search path, use the following command to build and run xv6:

```bash
make qemu
